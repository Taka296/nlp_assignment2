Maximum Yearly Insurable
Earnings

Maximum yearly insurable earnings

4 (1) For the purposes of subsection 14(1.1), section 17,
subsection 82(2) and sections 95 and 145, the maximum
yearly insurable earnings is $39,000 until the amount cal-
culated in accordance with subsection (2) for a year, be-
fore rounding down under subsection (4), ex-
ceeds $39,000, in which case the maximum yearly
insurable earnings for that year is that amount, rounded
down under subsection (4).

Calculation of amount

(2) The amount referred to in subsection (1) is the
amount equal to 52 times the product obtained by multi-

plying

(a) the average for the 12-month period ending on
April 30 in the preceding year of the Average Weekly
Earnings for each month in that period

by

(b) the ratio that the average for the 12-month period
ending on April 30 in that preceding year of the Aver-
age Weekly Earnings for each month in that 12-month
period bears to the average for the 12-month period
ending 12 months prior to April 30 of that preceding
year of the Average Weekly Earnings for each month
in that 12-month period ending 12 months prior to
April 30 of that preceding year.

Subsequent years

(3) For years subsequent to the year in which the maxi-
mum yearly insurable earnings exceeds $39,000, before
rounding down under subsection (4), the maximum year-
ly insurable earnings is the maximum yearly insurable
earnings for the preceding year, before rounding down
under that subsection, multiplied by the ratio that the

30 of that preceding year of the Average Weekly Earnings
for each month in that 12-month period ending 12
months prior to April 30 of that preceding year.

Rounding down

(4) If the amount calculated in accordance with subsec-
tion (2) or (3) is not a multiple of one hundred dollars,
the amount of the maximum yearly insurable earnings is
rounded down to the nearest multiple of one hundred
dollars.

Average Weekly Earnings

(5) The Average Weekly Earnings for a month is the av-
erage weekly earnings of the Industrial Aggregate in
Canada for the month as published by Statistics Canada
under the authority of the Statistics Act.

section (1) in more than two initial claims for benefits
under this Act by an individual if the individual who ac-
cumulated the violation qualified for benefits in each of
those two initial claims, taking into account subsection
(1), subparagraph 152.07(1)(d)(ii) or regulations made
under Part VIII, as the case may be.

posed, each violation is classified as a minor, serious,
very serious or subsequent violation as follows:

(a) if the value of the violation is
(i) less than $1,000, it is a minor violation,

(ii) $1,000 or more, but less than $5,000, it is a seri-
ous violation, or

(iii) $5,000 or more, it is a very serious violation;
and

(b) if the notice of violation is issued within 260 weeks
after the person accumulates another violation, it is a

When disqualification is to be served

(2) Subject to subsections (3) to (5), the weeks of dis-
qualification are to be served during the weeks following
the waiting period for which benefits would otherwise be
payable if the disqualification had not been imposed and,
for greater certainty, the length of the disqualification is
not affected by any subsequent loss of employment by
the claimant during the benefit period.

Disqualification to be carried forward

(3) Any portion of the disqualification that has not been
served when the claimant’s benefit period ends shall,
subject to subsections (4) and (5), be served in any bene-

against a claimant who has had 700 or more hours of in-
surable employment since the event giving rise to the dis-
qualification.

Deferral

Exception

from requesting that a benefit period established for the
claimant as a minor attachment claimant be cancelled
under subsection 10(6) and that a benefit period be es-
tablished for the claimant as a major attachment
claimant to enable the claimant to receive special bene-
fits.

Disqualification — misconduct or leaving without just
cause

30 (1) A claimant is disqualified from receiving any
benefits if the claimant lost any employment because of
their misconduct or voluntarily left any employment
without just cause, unless

(a) the claimant has, since losing or leaving the em-
ployment, been employed in insurable employment
for the number of hours required by section 7 or 7.1 to
qualify to receive benefits; or

(b) the claimant is disentitled under sections 31 to 33
in relation to the employment.

Length of disqualification

(2) The disqualification is for each week of the claimant’s
benefit period following the waiting period and, for
greater certainty, the length of the disqualification is not
affected by any subsequent loss of employment by the
claimant during the benefit period.

Not retroactive

(3) If the event giving rise to the disqualification occurs
during a benefit period of the claimant, the disqualifica-
tion does not include any week in that benefit period be-
fore the week in which the event occurs.

Suspension

(4) Despite subsection (6), the disqualification is sus-
pended during any week for which the claimant is other-
wise entitled to special benefits.

Restriction on qualifying for benefits

described in subsection (1) makes an initial claim for
benefits, the following hours may not be used to qualify

other employment before the employment was lost or
left; and

(b) hours of insurable employment in any employ-
ment that the claimant subsequently loses or leaves, as
described in subsection (1).

Restriction on number of weeks and rate of benefits

(6) No hours of insurable employment in any employ-
ment that a claimant loses or leaves, as described in sub-
section (1), may be used for the purpose of determining
the maximum number of weeks of benefits under subsec-
tion 12(2) or the claimant’s rate of weekly benefits under
section 14.

Interpretation

(7) For greater certainty, but subject to paragraph (1)(a),
a claimant may be disqualified under subsection (1) even
if the claimant’s last employment before their claim for
benefits was not lost or left as described in that subsec-
tion and regardless of whether their claim is an initial
claim for benefits.

duct or voluntarily leaves without just cause within three

during any week for which the claimant is otherwise enti-
tled to special benefits.

Exception

35 Notwithstanding anything in this Part, no claimant is
disqualified or disentitled under sections 30 to 33 from
receiving benefits only because the claimant left or re-
fused to accept employment if, by remaining in or accept-
ing the employment, the claimant would lose the right

(a) to become or refrain from becoming a member of
an association, organization or union of workers; or

(b) to continue to be a member and to observe the
lawful rules of an association, organization or union of

tioned in subsection (1).

ing any period for which the claimant

to special benefits or benefits by virtue of section 25;
and

may direct, that before the work stoppage, the
claimant had anticipated being absent from their em-
ployment because of any reason entitling them to
those benefits and had begun making arrangements in
relation to the absence.

Non-application

(4) This section does not apply if a claimant proves that
the claimant is not participating in, financing or directly
interested in the labour dispute that caused the stoppage
of work.

(5) If separate branches of work that are commonly car-
ried on as separate businesses in separate premises are
carried on in separate departments on the same premis-
es, each department is, for the purpose of this section, a

the remuneration of an insured person as or on account

sured person but has not remitted the amount to the Re-
ceiver General, the employer is deemed, notwithstanding
any security interest (as defined in subsection 224(1.3) of
the Income Tax Act) in the amount so deducted, to hold
the amount separate and apart from the property of the
employer and from property held by any secured creditor
(as defined in subsection 224(1.3) of the Income Tax Act)
of that employer that but for the security interest would
be property of the employer, in trust for Her Majesty and
for payment to Her Majesty in the manner and at the
time provided under this Act.

Extension of trust

Act (except sections 81.1 and 81.2 of that Act), any other
enactment of Canada, any enactment of a province or any

Majesty in the manner and at the time provided under
this Act, property of the employer and property held by
any secured creditor (as defined in subsection 224(1.3) of
the Income Tax Act) of that employer that but for a secu-
rity interest (as defined in subsection 224(1.3) of the In-
come Tax Act) would be property of the employer, equal
in value to the amount so deemed to be held in trust is
deemed

(a) to be held, from the time the amount was deduct-
ed by the employer, separate and apart from the prop-
erty of the employer, in trust for Her Majesty whether
or not the property is subject to such a security inter-
est, and

ployer and whether or not the property is subject to
such a security interest

and is property beneficially owned by Her Majesty

in the proceeds thereof, and the proceeds of such proper-
ty shall be paid to the Receiver General in priority to all
such security interests.

Meaning of security interest

(2.2) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (2.1), a se-
curity interest does not include a prescribed security in-
terest.

Certificate before distribution

sponsible representative has control in that capacity, the
responsible representative shall obtain a certificate from
the Minister certifying the payment, or acceptance by the
Minister of security for payment, of all amounts

to and including the date of distribution; and

sentative is or can reasonably be expected to become
liable in that capacity.

more persons property over which the responsible repre-
sentative has control in that capacity, without obtaining
the certificate, the responsible representative is personal-
ly liable for the payment of the amounts to the extent of
the value of the property distributed and the Minister
may assess the responsible representative for the
amounts in the same manner and with the same effect as
an assessment made under section 85.

Security

case, the Minister may accept security for payment of
premiums by way of mortgage, hypothec or other charge
of any kind whatever on property of the employer or any
